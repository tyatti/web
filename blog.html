5:34 pm, 26/10/2024, i  just watched some videos on recursive sorting algorithms on merge sort and quick sort, i'm excited to implement it somehow practically in my website, so here i'm trynna crate this random blog post out of nowhere,

features to include:
sort by length, time, date, year, tags(maybe), search specific words on entire blog , by comments(no. of comments or something i'll think later, categorical sorting(text, lifestyle, religion, etc) )
